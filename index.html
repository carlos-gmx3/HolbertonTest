        <h1>Self learning, a unique path</h1>
        <p>
          More than ever, the list of online learning sites are huge and the courses in all of them are increasing, 
          even the companies encourages their employees to learn something new before the year ends.
          <br>
          Unlike the formal education, with universities setting the goals, you can choose the skills you want to learn
          make your time and start right away.
          <br>
          A path designed by a university might be depandable, something well know by the work field.
          <br>
          On the other hand, a path choosen by you is unique and the posibilities of knowing someone else 
          with your same skills after a bunch of courses goes lower and lower.          
        </p>

        <h2>Cost Benefit</h2>
        <blockquote>Nothing comes for free</blockquote>
        <p>
          When you are paying for something you appreciate it more? <br>
          Or the true price is the time you invest into something? <br>
        </p>
        <blockquote>If you want true greatness, you have to pay the full price for it</blockquote>
        <p>
          Is always better the education that you pay? <br>
          Or you just paying for the certification? <br>
        </p>
        <blockquote>Price is what you pay. Value is what you get</blockquote>
        <p>
          The true quality lies in your eyes, you criteria to choose something that 
          will help you on your path because doesn't matter how much you pay for a course or certification 
          in your laboral life you will be asked to do thing that you suppose to know and that's when all the 
          attention you put in your learning pays the price. 
        </p>
        <h3>Free college vs pay college</h3>
        <p>
          I guess that depends, varies from one college to other, in some paid college seems that 
          you just have to assit to get your grade. <br>
          Meanwhile in the fre colleges you have to fight for the available places but not all of them have 
          the most recent equipment for the practices or does't have it at all. one for another.
        </p>

        <h3>Free courses vs pay courses.</h3>
        <p>
          After a little bit of research anyone can find something reliable on the internet, 
          the main difference seems to be in the details, for example, on the paid area there are some backup, 
          teachers who you can rely your doubts because some knowledge is abstract and you need a small unraveling explanation.
        </p>

        <h2>Resourses</h2>
        <p>
          When where talking about software development, have a good library of resources is essential so, 
          in this site I've put a few courses and sources of knowledge that I found along my path.
